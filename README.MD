Hi all,

Here you cand find some of my little Swift projects for practice. 

## [BankersPlan](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/58a4636435ff13475d000a83/groups/630fb3382381cc0001829747)

John has some amount of money of which he wants to deposit a part f0 to the bank at the beginning of year 1. He wants to withdraw each year for his living an amount c0.

Here is his banker plan:

+ deposit f0 at beginning of year 1
+ his bank account has an interest rate of p percent per year, constant over the years
+ John can withdraw each year c0, taking it whenever he wants in the year; he must take account of an inflation of i percent per year in order to keep his quality of living. i is supposed to stay constant over the years.
+ all amounts f0..fn-1, c0..cn-1 are truncated by the bank to their integral part
+ Given f0, p, c0, i the banker guarantees that John will be able to go on that way until the nth year.

Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.


## [Multiplies3or5](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/58b48124ce1056b00e001073/groups/627f583c31a327000125b3ac)
### 6 kyu

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

## [RomanNumeralDecoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/588fda338758342a73001286/groups/627ec0e43d0ec80001129a08)
### 6 kyu

Create a function that takes a Roman numeral as its argument and returns its value as a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to validate the form of the Roman numeral.


## [Count-the-digit](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/5b33a0e4a2bd9e5ef0001806/groups/627f75b531a327000125b91b)
### 7 kyu

Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.

Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.

Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.

Call nb_dig (or nbDig or ...) the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how the function accum works:

Examples:

accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"


## MagicCalculator
### Codecademy

Contains closures and Bubble Sort Algorythm.


## Is-he-gonna-survive 
### 8 kyu
Each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive? Return True if yes, False otherwise
